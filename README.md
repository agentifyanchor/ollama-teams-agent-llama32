# Ollama Teams Agent with Llama3.2

> **Note:** This project is a modified version of the original [Microsoft Teams AI sample](https://github.com/microsoft/teams-ai). While the original sample requires Microsoft 365 Copilot and Azure OpenAI, this version leverages a local Ollama server running the Llama3.2 model for natural language processing. This allows you to build and test your Microsoft Teams bot-based message extension agent without needing Microsoft 365 Copilot licenses.

## Overview

In this repository, we show you how to integrate Ollama with Microsoft Teams to build a free bot-based message extension agent. The agent uses natural language processing (NLP) powered by the Llama3.2 model, hosted locally with Ollama, instead of relying on Microsoft 365 Copilot and Azure OpenAI services.

This approach allows for easier local development without the need for cloud subscriptions, keeping costs low while still enabling the development of advanced features with natural language processing.

### Key Differences:
- **Original Setup:** Requires an Azure subscription and access to Microsoft 365 Copilot and Azure Open AI Studio.
- **Modified Version:** Runs on a local Ollama server with Llama3.2 for NLP, no Azure subscription needed, and no Copilot license required.

Feel free to contribute and build upon this project. If you want to try out Microsoft 365 Copilot or Azure OpenAI in the future, you can easily switch back to the original approach by updating your configuration and integrating the Azure services.
